# (Deprecated) Compression and Decompression for Arduino

** This library has been deprecated**. Use [Unishox_Arduino_lib](https://github.com/siara-cc/Unishox_Arduino_lib) instead. It has same features and more.

Shox96 is a technique for compressing short strings.  This library provides for Arduino the same API as the desktop version at [Shox96 - Guaranteed compression for Short Strings](https://github.com/siara-cc/Shox96).

To find out how Shox96 works, read [this article](https://github.com/siara-cc/Shox96/blob/master/Shox96_Article_0_2_0.pdf?raw=true).

## Usage

The following API can be used for compressing and decompressing strings or files:

```
long shox96_0_2_0_compress(const char *in, long len, char *out, struct lnk_lst *ll);
long shox96_0_2_0_decompress(const char *in, long len, char *out, struct lnk_lst *ll);
```

The last parameter can be NULL.  See example provided for demonstration of usage or see the documentation at https://github.com/siara-cc/Shox96 for further details.

For using Shox96 to store compressed data in Progmem of Arduino Uno and up, see the library at https://github.com/siara-cc/Shox96_Arduino_Progmem_lib.

## Screenshots

The example provided with this library allows you to enter a string and see how much compression can be achieved.  In general, compression utilities such as `zip`, `gzip` do not compress short strings well and often expand them.  They also use lots of memory which makes them unusable in constrained environments like Arduino.
